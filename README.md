# What does the mod do?

**NOTE: For easy configuration please use [ModConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/PEAKModding/ModConfig), you can edit values in game!**

This mod adds a green screen to the game into the Airport scene! Includes 10 configs to change the color values (RGB 0-255) of the green screen and currently replaces the area where the scoutmaster is hiding.
It is recommended you get a freecam mod as well (PEAKCinema) as then you are able to get images of your character using it.

> Now supporting Airport Remixed! The green screen will be moved to the room behind the elevators.

The 10 configs are as follows:
## General
- ColorR (Default: 0)
- ColorG (Default: 255)
- ColorB (Default: 0)
- SunLighting (Default: True/On)
- Disable Festive Airport (Default: False/Off)
## Front Left Light
- FL Intensity (Default: 1.0f)
- FL SpotAngle (Default: 120f)
- FL Light Active (Default: True/On)
## Front Right Light
- FR Intensity (Default: 1.0f)
- FR SpotAngle (Default: 120f)
- FR Light Active (Default: True/On)
